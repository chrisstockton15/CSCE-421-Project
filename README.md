# CSCE-421-Project
Final Project for CSCE 421 Machine Learning

NOTE: I had a partner for this project, but they did not respond to any of my messages after the proposal was written. They also barely even contributed to the proposal. I am guessing he dropped the class. All of the final materials were completed on my own.

Implements Yolov3 using Darknet. GitHub link: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet

Code was ran in Google Colab in order to make use of a virtual GPU (detailed in report). Use Glasses_Detection.ipynb in google colab to run code. the glasses_detection.py file was provided to show the commands used in case you cant view the .ipnnb, but is unable to be ran.

I am unable to attach my personal darknet file with the weights and data that I used because the files are too big to be uploaded to github. The base darknet file can be found above and the base Yolo weights can be found at https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/ if you are trying to run this code yourself. Feel free to email me at chrisstockton15@tamu.edu if you have any questions.
