# CSCE-421-Project
Final Project for CSCE 421 Machine Learning
NOTE: I had a partner for this project, but they did not respond to any of my messages after the proposal was written. They also barely even contributed to the proposal. I am guessing he dropped the class. All of the final materials were completed on my own.
Implements Yolov3 using Darknet. GitHub link: https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet
Code was ran in Google Colab in order to make use of a virtual GPU (detailed in report). Use Glasses_detection.ipynb in google colab to run code. the Glasses_Detection.py file was provided to show the commands used in case you cant view the .ipnnb, but is unable to be ran.
